# webapp-urltools

A Chrome extension providing URL editing and copying tools optimized for web applications running in `--app` mode, particularly useful for Omarchy users.

## Features

### ðŸ”— Edit Current URL (`Ctrl+Shift+E` / `Cmd+Shift+E`)
- Opens an inline modal to edit the current page URL
- Smart URL detection:
  - URLs with dots (.) are treated as web addresses
  - Plain text is treated as a search query using your default search engine
- Works in both regular browser tabs and `--app` mode windows
- Close modal with `Escape` or by clicking outside

### ðŸ“‹ Rich Copy URL (`Ctrl+Shift+Y` / `Cmd+Shift+Y`)
- Copies the current URL with intelligent formatting:
  - **Plain text contexts** (terminal, text editors): Just the URL
  - **Rich text contexts** (Logseq, Obsidian, markdown editors): Formatted as `[Page Title](URL)`
- Shows a toast notification confirming the copy
- Perfect for quickly capturing references while working

   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner

### Updating the Extension

When you pull updates or make changes:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find webapp-urltools
3. Click the refresh icon (â†») on the extension card

### Troubleshooting Installation

- **"Manifest file is missing or unreadable"**: Make sure you selected the correct folder containing `manifest.json`
- **Extension not working in app mode**: Reload the app window after installing
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Check for conflicts at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Edit URL | `Ctrl+Shift+E` | `Cmd+Shift+E` |
| Copy URL | `Ctrl+Shift+Y` | `Cmd+Shift+Y` |

### Customizing Shortcuts

You can customize keyboard shortcuts at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

**Note about Ctrl+Shift+C**: While you might prefer `Ctrl+Shift+C` for copying, this shortcut is reserved by Chrome DevTools and cannot be overridden by extensions. `Ctrl+Shift+Y` is the recommended alternative.

## Why This Extension?

This extension was created specifically to address the limitations of Chrome's `--app` mode, which is heavily used in Omarchy and other PWA-focused workflows. Standard Chrome extensions often fail to inject content scripts into app mode windows, making it difficult to add functionality to web apps running as standalone applications.

### Key Benefits for App Mode Users:
- **Works everywhere**: Unlike typical extensions, webapp-urltools uses declarative content scripts that load at document start, ensuring functionality in app mode
- **No browser chrome needed**: All features work through keyboard shortcuts and inline UI, perfect for distraction-free app windows
- **Smart clipboard handling**: Rich copy feature adapts to where you're pasting, making it seamless to capture references

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3**: Built using the latest Chrome extension standards
- **Content Scripts**: Declaratively injected at document_start for maximum compatibility
- **Offscreen Documents**: Used for reliable clipboard operations
- **Fallback Chains**: Multiple injection methods ensure the extension works across all contexts

### Files
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `background.js` - Service worker handling commands and messaging
- `content-listener.js` - Content script loaded on all pages
- `modal.js` - URL editing modal interface
- `notification.js` - Toast notification system
- `offscreen.js` / `offscreen.html` - Clipboard handling
- `popup.js` / `popup.html` - Fallback popup interface

## Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium 96+ (for dynamic content scripts)
- Works in:
  - Regular browser tabs
  - Chrome `--app` mode windows
  - PWAs (Progressive Web Apps)
  - Installed web apps

## Known Limitations

1. Cannot override Chrome's built-in shortcuts (like `Ctrl+Shift+C` for DevTools)
2. Some system-level pages (chrome://, edge://) cannot be modified
3. Requires host permissions for all sites to work universally
